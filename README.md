# MSCS630-722-Final-Project
A mobile Android app that utilizes AES to encrypt and decrypt stored data

4/14/16
  -Uploaded a working version of AEScipher.java to be used for testing decryption. Please check out the description for the commit. I will continue to refactor the code to optimize its performance as well as begin exploring implementations of a block cipher mode(probably CBC or possibly ECB depending on time constraints). Any questions please hit me up on WhatsApp. -Zach
