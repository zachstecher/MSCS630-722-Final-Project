# MSCS630-722-Final-Project
An extension of AES to handle 128, 192 and 256-bit keys, as well as any size message.

4/14/16
  -Uploaded a working version of AEScipher.java to be used for testing decryption. Please check out the description for the commit. I will continue to refactor the code to optimize its performance as well as begin exploring implementations of a block cipher mode(probably CBC or possibly ECB depending on time constraints). Any questions please hit me up on WhatsApp. -Zach

  -Uploaded the Driver file(forgot to do this last time, oops).
  -Zach will modify the existing aes and driver files to handle different sized keys and implement a block cipher mode.

  -Bhargavi and Thusharika will create the Decryption file to go along with this.
  
Any questions don't hesitate to ask over WhatsApp!
